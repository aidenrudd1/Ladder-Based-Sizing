    "From here, we will use our current inventory to adjust the size of the bid and ask quotes. We will use a value from [-1, 1] to represent our current inventory, and more specifically, our relationship with the base unit. For example in the market EURQ-USD, a value of 0.5 would represent us being long the base unit (EURQ). A negative value like -0.5 would represent us being short the base unit (EURQ). If we were long, that indicates that we have tooo much of the base and we should be pushing to sell off some of the excess. If we were short, that indicates that we have tooo little of the base and we should be pushing to buy more of the base. This is the core idea behind the sizing algorithm, the goal being simple, to keep our inventory close to neutral. "
